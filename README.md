Business Problem
The Financial Technology company (Fin-Tech Company) generally release there a mobile apps.Which is used for financial purposes like bank loans, savings, etc. in one place.Basically they have two versions free and premium. The free version app contains basic features and customer wants to use the premium feature then they have to pay some amount to unlock it.

The main goal of the company is to sell the premium version app with low advertisement cost but they don’t know how to do it. That’s a reason they are provided the premium feature in the free version app for 24 hours to collect the customer’s behavior.

Task
find or predict new customer who is interested to buy the product or not. If the customers will buy a product anyway so no need to give an offer to that customer. Only give offers to those customers who are interested to use premium version app but they can’t afford its cost. So the company will give offers to those customers and earn more money

Main Goal is to work on financial application data and predict the customer who will take a premium version app subscription or not. Then the company will take action on the customers to give the offers or not
